<h1>My Favourite Animes</h1>
<h2>My Top Animes of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>I know that Naruto is just a fictional character but he wants me to become a better person , it's so inspiring and beautiful.</br> I have learned how pure and strong connections can be . It may be friendship or love , it can be parental love or brother's love .</br> One of the greatest thing i ever did is that i watched this show and I'm truly grateful to god for it.  </p>

<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>AOT is a masterpiece and famous for it's plots in anime history.</br> It's themes are violence,discrimination,politics,and freedom emerged within a much deeper, more complex,and twisted plot.</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>It has amazing animation and a great storyline , It never dissappoints. </p>

<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>The protagonist of the show Light Yagami , is the most iconic character ever existed .</br>Though It's darker compared to the mainstream animes , every second of it is super interesting . </p>

<h3>Tokyo Revengers</h3>
<p>Can i say the boys are too pretty? lol.</br>
    But yeah , it is simply so much fun, great production and very good music, events that make you feel excited,</br> thrilled and shocked in every episode, but because of the writing and some gaps at the end of the season events I think it deserves 8.5/10. </p>
